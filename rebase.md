# Rebase




Example:

In our project’s Git repository, two branches currently exist: the usual master branch, and a feature branch that we created right after the initial commit. On the master branch, we have italicized the ‘a’, then bolded the ‘a’. On our feature branch, we have italicized the ‘b’, and then bolded the ‘b’.
